Do not use any tools or programming to solve these problems. Work it out yourself by hand, and fill in the answers.

Do not convert any binary numbers to decimal when solving a question unless the question explicitly tells you to.

The goal of these exercises is for you to gain an intuition for binary numbers. Using tools to solve the problems defeats the point.

Convert the decimal number 14 to binary.
Answer: Divide by 2 and record the remainders, then write the remainders in reverse order
14 / 2 = 7 R 0
7 / 2 = 3 R 1
3 / 2 = 1 R 1
1 / 2 = 0 R 1

Convert the binary number 101101 to decimal:
Answer:

2^0 x 1 = 1
2^1 x 0 = 0
2^2 x 1 = 4
2^3 x 1 = 8
2^4 x 0 = 0
2^5 x 1 = 32

1 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 0 + 32 = 45

Which is larger: 1000 or 0111?
Answer: 1000 is larger than 111

Which is larger: 00100 or 01011?
Answer: 01011 is larger because 1011 is larger than 100

What is 10101 + 01010?
Answer: 
  1 0 1 0 1
+ 0 1 0 1 0

Adding from right to left

1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
  11111

What is 10001 + 10001?
Answer:
  1 0 0 0 1  
+ 1 0 0 0 1  

Adding from right to left

1 + 1 = 10  = 0 carry 1
0 + 0 + carry 1 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 1 = 10

How can you test if a binary number is a power of two (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)?
Answer: 

Convert the decimal number 14 to hex.
Answer: E

Convert the decimal number 386 to hex.
Answer: 386 / 16 = 24 R 2
        24 / 16 = 1 R 8
        1 / 16 = 0 R 1
        = 0x182

Convert the hex number 386 to decimal.
Answer:
Going from right to left
16^0 x 6 = 1 x 6 = 6
16^1 x 8 = 16 x 8 = 128
16^2 x 3 = 256 x 3 = 768
  768 + 128 + 6 = 902

Convert the hex number B to decimal.
Answer: 11

If reading the byte 0x21 as a number, what decimal number would it mean?
Answer: 
16^0 x 1 = 1 x 1 = 1
16^1 x 2 = 16 x 2 = 32
   32 + 1 = 33

If reading the byte 0x21 as an ASCII character, what character would it mean?
Answer: !

If reading the byte 0x21 as a greyscale colour, as described in "Approaches for Representing Colors and Images", what colour would it mean?
Answer: 0x21 = 33
        The value of 33 out of 255 will be dark grey

If reading the bytes 0xAA00FF as an RGB colour, as described in "Approaches for Representing Colors and Images", what colour would it mean?
Answer: There's more blue, less red and no green = Bluish-purple

If reading the bytes 0xAA00FF as a sequence of three one-byte decimal numbers, what decimal numbers would they be?
Answer: 170, 0, 255
0xAA
A = 10
16^0 x 10 = 1 x 10 = 10
16^1 x 10 = 16 x 10 = 160
  160 + 10 = 170

0x00
= 0

0xFF
F = 15
16^0 x 15 = 1 x 15 = 15
16^1 x 15 = 16 x 15 = 240
   240 + 15 = 255
